# AI Frontier Labs - Part 1 - Horizontal GenAI Solutions for Customer Support 

- ## AI Automation:
LLM's have matured to a stage where they can now orchestrate the automation of complex workflows, leveraging tools (API's, code) and other LLM instances to carry out specific tasks. Although the architecture for AI Automation with LLM's is still evolving multiple-agents working in parallel is emerging as the dominant design pattern for automation of complex workflows. AutoGen is one of the dominant frameworks for AI Automation with LLM's, initially launched by Microsoft Research. In our workshop, we will be using AutoGen to implent an "agentic" customer support (CS) workflow for a FinTech. Scenario is designed to leverage different Azure data stores, tools and external API's.

We will touch on the challanges of deploying agentic, dynamic workflows automation such as...
- Long term memory (and retrieval)
- Reliable long term execution (Statefulness)
- Multi Agent coordination
- AI UX


- ## AzureOpenAI Real-time API
We will use a "voice UI" for our automation, driven by Azure OpenAI (AOAI) real-time API.
