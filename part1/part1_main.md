# ðŸŒŸ AI Frontier Labs - Part 1  
LLMs have matured to **orchestrate complex workflows**, leveraging **APIs, code, and other LLMs**. While AI automation is still evolving, **multi-agent systems** are emerging as the dominant approach.  
> **AutoGen**, developed by Microsoft Research, is a leading framework for AI-driven automation. 

"AI Automation" with LLM's has been a challange mostly because of...
- Function calling performance of LLM's 
- LLM's performance limits for decomposing complex tasks
- Lack of a consistent strategy for agent-memory frameworks to handle longer running workflows requiring statefulness

Potential "compounding errors" where multiple agents take on biased or incorrect results and amplify the biases and errors with each iteration, as well as risks with "high-stakes" tasks and concerns on AI safety and alignment has slowed down the adoption of autonomous AI systems too. 

Recent developments in "Reasoning LLM's" with their superior function calling performance with structured outputs, safety hardening with in-context reasoning made it possible to extend AI automation for non-deterministic tasks.
"Customer Support" by its own complex and non-deterministic nature is a great use-case to explore the potential of "AI Automation" with LLM's.
We will take on FinTech specific "Customer Support" use-cases with voice UI integrated with AutoGen for automation using data integareted with emerging paradigms such as "Graph RAG" and advanced omni-RAG.

Below is a step-by-step guide summary of what we will be building...
