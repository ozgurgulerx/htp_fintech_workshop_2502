    "# AI-Driven Call Center with OpenAI Real-Time Voice and AutoGen\n",

    "## AI-Driven Conversation Handling with AutoGen\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen and the Real-Time API are a powerful couple for AI-powered call centers because AutoGen can act as the intelligent backbone while the Real-Time API provides the seamless user interface. AutoGen decides how to handle each caller’s request—whether that means pulling data from external APIs, generating code, or delegating tasks to specialized sub-agents—while the Real-Time API continuously captures and transcribes the caller’s speech, returning AutoGen’s responses as synthesized audio in real time. This orchestrated approach gives call centers a flexible, voice-driven flow, where callers simply talk and hear spoken answers, while AutoGen invisibly coordinates the logic, function calling, and data retrieval in the background.\n",
