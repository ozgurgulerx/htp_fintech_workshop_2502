    "# AUTOGEN MULTI-AGENT ORCHESTRATION\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen's multi-agent orchestration enables seamless collaboration between AI agents, allowing them to autonomously delegate tasks, retrieve information, and execute complex workflows. By leveraging structured communication, tool integration, and intelligent decision-making, AutoGen facilitates scalable AI-driven applications across domains like research, automation, and customer support. With flexible orchestration models such as RoundRobin, SelectorGroupChat, and Swarm, developers can design adaptive multi-agent ecosystems that efficiently coordinate and optimize task execution."

    "Using multiple agents in AI Automation have the following benefits:\n",
    "- **Specialization:** Instead of one massive model trying to handle everything (translation, coding, web-surfing, etc.), you can compose smaller, specialized agents.\n",
    "- **Parallelism & Modularity:** Multiple agents can divide tasks or work in parallel without stepping on each other’s toes.\n",
    "- **Scalable Expertise:** You can plug in new agents (like a VideoSurfer, FileSurfer, or SQLQueryAgent) without rewriting existing logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "New requirements to manage the complexity of using multiple agents...\n",
    "- **Orchestration:** If multiple agents can respond at once, you need a coordinating mechanism (how do they know who speaks next? do they pass tasks around?). AutoGen provides RoundRobinGroupChat, SelectorGroupChat, Swarm, and MagenticOneGroupChat for this orchestration.\n",
    "- **Shared Context & State:** Agents must see the most recent conversation state and outputs of other agents. AutoGen’s team concept ensures agents share a single conversation thread or message buffer.\n",
    "- **Tool Integration:** Each agent might call external APIs. If they conflict, you need to define a tool schema or allow parallel/discrete usage. In AutoGen, you can pass different tools or function-call endpoints to each agent. That way, the finance agent might have a currency API tool, while a web-search agent has a search tool.\n",
    "- **Memory & Persistence:** Long-running multi-agent applications need a memory store to recall user preferences, partial results, or conversation states across steps. AutoGen’s Memory interface (e.g., ListMemory, vector-based memory) can store facts so that all agents can retrieve relevant knowledge.-"

We create two agents—one with multiple tools, and a second “critic” agent—then place them in a RoundRobinGroupChat so they can take turns responding. This setup demonstrates how to integrate Azure OpenAI, load environment variables, define tool functions, and orchestrate more than one agent in a conversation."

      "Imagine you have two entangled particles, like a pair of shoes: one left shoe and one right shoe.
