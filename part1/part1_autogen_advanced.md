# **Part 2 - Advanced AutoGen Capabilities: Multi-Agent Collaboration & Autonomy**  

In this section, we take AutoGen to the next level by introducing **multi-agent collaboration**, **role-based delegation**, and **custom routing**. While Part 1 focused on setting up a single **AssistantAgent** and handling function calls, Part 2 explores how multiple agents can **interact, share responsibilities, and make autonomous decisions**. 

We will implement **parallel function execution** to optimize performance, design agents with distinct **roles and expertise**, and introduce **decision-making mechanisms** that allow agents to dynamically **route tasks** based on context. Finally, we will explore **agent autonomy and self-prompting**, where agents analyze their responses and refine them iteratively. Through **hands-on examples**, we will demonstrate how these concepts lead to **scalable, intelligent AI workflows**.

   - Introduction to **UserAgent**, **FunctionAgent**, and **AssistantAgent**  
   - Agents communicating and exchanging data  
   - Basic multi-agent chat workflow  

### 2. [**Role-Based Agents & Delegation**](./part1_autogen_advanced_role_based_agents.ipynb)
   - Assigning **specialized agents** for different tasks  
   - Example: **Finance agent**, **Weather agent**, **IT support agent**  
   - **Task delegation**: How an agent decides who should handle a query  

### 3. [**Custom Routing & Multi-Agent Decision-Making**](./part1_autogen_advanced_custom_routing.ipynb)
   - Implementing **agent-driven decision-making**  
   - Example: A **customer support agent** that decides between answering directly or calling an external API  
   - **Dynamic task delegation**: Routing tasks based on the type of query  

### 4. [**Parallel Execution of Function Calls**](./part1_autogen_advanced_parallel_execution.ipynb)
   - Optimizing workflows by running multiple function calls **asynchronously**  
   - Example: Fetching **weather, currency exchange, and local time** **simultaneously**  
   - How **parallel execution** improves response speed  

### 5. [**Agent Autonomy & Self-Prompting**](./part1_autogen_advanced_agent_autonomy.ipynb)
   - Enabling agents to **self-reflect** and **improve their own answers**  
   - Example: A **research agent** that verifies and refines its own outputs  
   - Introducing **multi-step reasoning** where agents iteratively **generate, critique, and refine** responses  

This section will **bridge simple AI automation with sophisticated agent collaboration**, setting the stage for **building intelligent, scalable AI workflows**. ðŸš€
